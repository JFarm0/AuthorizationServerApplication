# OAuth-Prototype-Server

This was a prototype/proof of concept OAuth 2.0 Server that I built as a solution to our Authentication and Authorization needs for our capstone project. This application was brought to the group, however the group voted to not implement this feature. Worked in conjunction with the [OAuth-Prototype-Client-Okta](https://github.com/JFarm0/OAuth-Prototype-Client-Okta) application.
